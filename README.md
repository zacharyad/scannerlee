# Scannerlee App

This project will allow users to login using supabase Authentication (email, password and Magic link), create a qr code that is tied to a page that only the signed in user can edit (jus text at this point). The user can then share this QR code and any scans will take others to view signed in users page (could be printed on shirt, on a sticker, or anywhere QR codes make sense).

The idea is to give a barrier to access content generated by a user. If this QR is printed on a shirt, the message on the shirt can change with the edit of the webpage and another scan by the next person. 

This project is being created to work with Supabase as a technology, work on building a user centric application, continue to improve my react knowledge, and also to be creative with code.

Tuture facets of this project may include a paid option to buy the qr code via a pre printed shirt that is sent to the user, making admin portal for site admins but also printers to see orders and ship to users.
